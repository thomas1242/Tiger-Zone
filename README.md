## **Architecture/Design Documentation**
![UML with Client](https://github.com/thomas1242/Tiger-Zone/blob/master/Images/UML%20(Client).png?raw=true)
                                            UML with Client


## **Source Code**
- Code is in C++ and is cointained in 'src'.
- An implementation with the testable GUI (and no client) is in the 'game_with_GUI' folder.

## **Class Descriptions**
Main

- Highest level.
- Controls two games, and and Input/Output class.
- Manages connection with server via TCP socket.

Game

- Second highest level architecturally.
- Gives abilitity for players to make moves.
- Contains Board (and Deck in non-client versions).

Player

- Changes both the board and card objects.
- Makes decisions based on the Board's possible moves.

Board

- Contains matrix of cards.
- Keeps track of terrain and tiger locations.
- Stores a 2D array of possible moves.
..* AI players can use this array to make decisions.

Deck (only for non-client version)

- Stack of cards to be drawn by the game and given to the Player.

Card

- Contains edges with terrain types.
- Is passed from Server->Main->Game->Player->Board.
- A unique ID can be passed through the server.

Input/Output

- Utilized by server to store or queue relevant data for server connection.

### __Extra Stuff__
- With GUI (no client)
    ..* SFML Dependencies: http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/
    ..* use main_with_GUI.cpp instead of main.cpp
  
- Test Server
  ..* Compile with 'g++ -o server server.cpp'
  ..* Run with ./server
  ..* Press any key to iterate through messages once connected by TCP socket.
  
## **Testing**
### Unit Testing
#### Googletest
..* ![Google Test](https://github.com/thomas1242/Tiger-Zone/blob/master/Images/googletest.png?raw=true)
..* Additional print statements are output within code.

### Integration Testing
#### Testing client with a mock server
![Server](https://github.com/thomas1242/Tiger-Zone/blob/master/Images/client_mock_server%20communication.png)
..* Included Test folder showcasing tests

### Acceptance Testing
#### GUI plugin (Not compatible with server)
..* SFML dependencies required. http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/

## **Current Bugs**
- Timeout/loop issue in input.cpp
- Currently no error checking if user too few command line arguments.
