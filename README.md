## Overview

Players take turns placing tiles. As they so do, the roads, lakes, and jungles emerge and grow.

Tiles must be placed adjacent to at least one previously placed tile, and all road, lake, and jungle segments on the new tile must continue to road, lake, and jungle segments on all adjacent tiles.  

Players may place tigers to claim territories. A tiger may be placed in any jungle, lake, road or den which does *not* already contain a tiger.
